(* --- Generators --- *)

   You will need to write generators for your 'covering' type or its components.
   This is often the most challenging part of setting up PBT.
   For now, we use a simple placeholder. *)

let test_compute_good_is_valid =
  Test.make ~count:100 ~name:"compute_good_covering produces a valid covering"
    ~print:print_tree covering_gen (fun c ->
      let gc = compute_good_covering c in

      | true -> true
      | false ->
          Test.fail_report
            "Result of compute_good_covering is not a valid covering"
      (* This assumes 'is_covering' correctly defines validity *))

(* Property 2: The result of compute_good_covering should be a 'good' covering. *)
let test_compute_good_is_good =
  Test.make ~count:100 ~name:"compute_good_covering produces a 'good' covering"
    ~print:print_tree covering_gen (fun c ->
      let gc = compute_good_covering c in
      match is_good_covering gc with
      | true -> true
      | false ->
          Test.fail_report
            "Result of compute_good_covering is not a 'good' covering"
      (* This assumes 'is_good_covering' correctly defines goodness *))

(* TODO: Add more properties as needed, for example:
   - Idempotence: compute_good_covering (compute_good_covering c) == compute_good_covering c (requires an equality/equivalence function)
   - Preservation: Check that the good covering 'gc' covers the same set of points as the original 'c' (requires a way to check point membership)
   - Properties of specific covering constructor functions you might write.
*)

(* --- Run Tests --- *)
